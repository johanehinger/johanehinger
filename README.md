## Hi, I'm Johan Ehinger ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer from Sweden. Iâ€™m interested in full stack development and helping people. 
The main things Iâ€™m focusing on right now is contributing to open-source projects (watch me try and contribute to [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip)) 
and my education at [LinkÃ¶pings University](https://liu.se/) where Iâ€™m studying Computer science and Engineering. On my spare time Iâ€™m 
developing a full stack solution for a customer at my own company and Iâ€™m always looking for the next project, so hit me up if you like.
